# Sudoku_solver
System for solving sudokus with a number of different algorithms.

First algorithm is a BFS brute-force algorithm.

TODO: Implement different algorithms, such as socastic processes (Simulated Annealing, etc.), 
and neural networks (recognises patterns in other sudoku puzzles and their solutions, using DL4J or Simbrain).
